<p>
The medium through which most of us experience language most of the time is sound:  for all non-deaf language users, the first exposure to language is through sound, and in non-literate, hearing societies it is typically the only medium. Humans have a variety of ways of producing sounds, not all of which are relevant to language (for example coughing, burping, etc.). How sound is use language, that is, speech sounds, is the focus of this book, and one obvious place to start out is to look at the physical processes involved in the production of speech sounds by speakers — the study of articulatory phonetics. </p>

<p>This chapter examines (he major aspects of speech production: 
<ul><li> the airstream mechanism — where the air used in speech starts from, and which direction it is travelling in.
<li> the state of the vocal cords — whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, which determines voicing 
<li> the state of the velum — whether it is raised or lowered, which determines whether a sound is oral or nasal
<li> the place and manner of articulation — the horizontal and vertical positions of the tongue and lips. </ul></p>

<p>In Chapters 3 and 4 we look in some detail at different speech sounds. beginning with the various types of consonant and then moving on to vowels. The primary focus is on speech sounds found in different varieties of English. particularly Received Pronunciation CRP) and General American (GenAm). RP refers to a non-regional pronunciation found mainly in the United Kingdom, sometimes known non-technically as ‘BBC English’ or ‘the Queen's English’. General American refers to a standardized form of North American English. often associated with broadcast journalism and, thus, sometimes known as ‘network English’. Although the focus is on English, exemplification will also come from Other languages.
