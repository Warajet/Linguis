<font size = "+5">Articulatory Phonetics: Airstream mechanism</font>
<p>We can Start with the airflow itself — where is it initiated and which direction is it travelling in? The major 'initiator' is the lungs and the most common direction is for the air to flow out from the lungs through the trachea (windpipe), larynx (in the Adam's apple) and vocal tract (mouth and nose): all human languages involve this type of airstream mechanism, known as ‘pulmonic egressive' (= from the lungs outwards) and for many, including English, it is the sole airstream mechanism employed for speech sounds. A number of languages also employ other possibilities: the air may be moving inwards (an ingressive airstream mechanism), the flow itself may begin al the velum (soft palate) or the glottis (the space between the vocal cords) — velaric and glottalic airstreams respectively. This gives a possible six airstream mechanisms: 
<ul>
<li>pulmonic egressive — used in all human languages 
<li>pulnlonic ingressive — not round 
<li>velaric egressive — not found 
<li>velaric ingressive — used in e.g. Zulu (S. Africa) 
<li>glottalic egressive — used in e.g. Navajo (N. America) 
<li>glottalic ingressive — used in e.g. Sindhi (India).
</ul>
</p>
<p>
However, as can be seen from the list above, two of the possible types — pulmonic ingressive and velaric egressive — are not found in any human language (it is unclear why this is so). 
Having established the starting point of the airflow and the direction it is travelling in, we can then look at what happens to it as it moves over the other organs involved in speech sound production. For what follows, we will assume a pulmonic egressive airstream mechanism; sounds produced with Other airstream types will be discussed in later sections.
