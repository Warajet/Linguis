<font size = "+5">The oral tract  </font><p>
    We have thus far considered the type of airstream mechanism involved in the production of a speech sound, the state of the vocal cords (whether the sound is voiced or voiceless, for instance) and the state of the velum (whether the sound is nasal or oral). We must now look at the state of the oral tract: in particular, the position of the active articulators (lower lip and tongue) in relation to the passive articulators (the upper surfaces of the oral tract). 
The active articulators are, as their name suggests, the bits that move — the lower lip and the tongue. It is convenient to consider the tongue as consisting of a number of sections (though these cannot move entirely independently, of course). These are: the tip, blade, front, back and root: the front and back together are referred to as the body (see Figure 2.6). The passive articulators are the non-mobile parts — the upper lip, the teeth, the roof of the mouth and the pharynx wall. The roof of the mouth is further subdivided into alveolar ridge, hard palate, soft palate (or velum) and uvula (see, again, Figure 2.6). Consideration of the relative position of active and passive articulators allows us to specify what are known as the manner of articulation and the place of articulation of the speech sound. These will be discussed in detail in the following two chapters: for the moment, a brief survey will suffice.
