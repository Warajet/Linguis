Manner of articulation refers to the vertical relationship between the active and passive articulators, i.e. the distance between them (usually known as stricture): anything from being close together, preventing air escaping, to wide apart, allowing air to flow through unhindered. 
When the articulators are pressed together (known as complete closure), a blockage to the airflow is created, causing air pressure to build up behind the blockage. When the blockage is removed the air is released in a rush. The sounds produced in this way are known as stops; these may be oral (with velum raised), as in the first and last sounds in 'bad', or nasal (lowered velum), as in the first and last sounds in ‘man' — the only difference between these words is the position of the velum, since the active articulators are in the same positions for both words.

The first and last sounds in ‘church' also involve complete closure, but have a different release of air. In the oral stops we have looked at so far, the active articulator is lowered completely, giving a wide ‘escape hole’ for the air, as for the stop sounds in ‘bad': for the first and last sounds in the active articulator is lowered only slightly. giving a slower release of the air through a narrow channel between the articulators. As the air passes through this narrow space there is friction (see fricatives in the next paragraph). Sounds produced in this way are known as affricates. 
When the articulators are close together, but without complete closure (a stricture known as close approximation), the air is forced through the narrow gap between the articulators, causing some turbulence; sounds so produced are known as fricatives (the first and last sounds in ‘fez'). 
For the other major sound types — liquids, glides and vowels — there is free passage of air through the oral tract. though the exact relation between the articulators will vary. For vowels (the middle sounds in ‘cat’. ‘dog'. ‘meat', etc.) and glides (sometimes known as 'semi-vowels') (the initial sounds in ‘yak' and 'warthog'), the articulators are wide apart and the air flows out unhindered (this is known as open approximation). For liquids (the first and last sounds in ‘rail'), there is both contact and free air passage: for the 'r' sound. the sides of the tongue are in contact with the gums. but the air flows freely down the centre of the tongue, and for the ‘l' sound. the centre of the tongue is in contact with the alveolar ridge but the air flows out freely over the lowered sides of the tongue —see Section 3.5.
