<font size = "+5">The velum </font><p>
    The position of the velum is the next consideration. The velum, or soft palate, is a muscular flap at the back of the roof of the mouth: this may be raised — cutting off the nasal tract — or lowered — allowing air into and through the nose (see Figure 2.6). When the velum is raised (known as ‘velic closure'). the air can Only flow into the oral tract, that is. the mouth: sounds produced in this way are known as oral sounds (all those in ‘frog', for example). When the velum is lowered, air flows into both mouth and nose, resulting in nasal sounds (the first and last sounds in ‘man’, or the vowel in French pain 'bread', for example). </p>
