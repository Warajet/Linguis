<font size = "+5">Speech sound classification</font>
<p>
    We now have a method of describing the articulation of any speech sound by specifying (1) the airstream mechanism, (2) the state of the vocal cords, (3) the position of the velum, (4) the place of articulation and (5) the manner of articulation. Thus, the first sound in 'pig’ could be classified — using these five features — as a pulmonic egressive, voiceless, oral, bilabial stop.

In fact, for consonants, it is more usual to use a three term classification, referring to voicing, place and manner, with airstream and velum only referred to when they are not pulmonic egressive and oral respectively; thus the ‘p' sound in ‘pig' is normally referred to as a voiceless bilabial stop. 'z' as in ‘fez' is a voiced alveolar fricative. For vowels, the classification is slightly different: voicing is typically irrelevant, since in most languages, vowels are always voiced, and the vertical (manner for consonants) and horizontal (place for consonants) dimensions are more restricted. All vowels are produced with a stricture of open approximation, so manner as such is irrelevant: however, different vowels do involve differences in the highest point of the tongue: for the vowel sound in ‘sit' the tongue is higher than for the vowel sound in ‘sat'; we refer to ‘high', ‘mid' and ‘low’ vowels. Horizontally, vowels are restricted to the palatal and velar regions; compare the vowels in 'fee' (made in the palatal area) and ‘for’ (made further back in the velar area); in this dimension we refer to vowels as ‘front’, ‘central' and ‘back'. There is a further consideration for vowels, however, not usually relevant for consonants: that of lip rounding. (Note that even though the upper lip is considered a passive articulator, it does participate in lip rounding.) The vowel sound in 'see' involves no lip rounding, while the lips are rounded for the vowel sound in 'sue': you can check this by looking in a mirror as you say these sounds. Thus the vowel sound in 'see' can be referred to as a high front unrounded vowel, that in as a mid back round vowel.
