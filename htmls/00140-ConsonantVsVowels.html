<font size = "+5">Consonant vs Vowels </font>
<p>
    Syllable structure plays a role when we attempt to clarify a major distinction between speech-sound types that we have thus far simply been assuming: that between consonants and vowels. This is not as straightforward as if might at first appear: at first glance, the essential difference would seem to have to do with degree of stricture, i.e. the distance between the active and passive articulators. For consonants there is some kind of obstruction in the oral tract, whereas for vowels there is no such hindrance to the outflow of the air. Thus, stops (oral and nasal), fricatives and liquids all involve a stricture of at least close approximation. Liquids and nasals might appear to be counterexamples to this claim, since the air flows out freely for these sound types. In each case, however, there is some obstruction in the oral tract; for nasals, complete closure (since they are stops). For liquids, there is some contact between articulators, but this does not extend across the full width of the oral tract — so. for the ‘l' in ‘lion', the middle of the tongue tip is in contact with the alveolar ridge, but the sides of the tongue are lowered, allowing free airflow. 
The class of glides is a problem for this definition, however, since for them there is a stricture of open approximation. For these sounds, the consonant/vowel distinction rests not so much with the phonetics as with the phonology. That is, it has to do with how the sounds function in the language, rather than with the details of their articulation. True vowels like the ‘i’ in ‘pig’ are syllabic: that is, they comprise the essential part of the syllable, known as the nucleus, and without which there would not be a syllable (for details of syllable structure, see Section 2.3 and Chapter 6). Glides, on the other hand, behave like consonants in that they do not form the nuclei of syllables, but rather occur on the edges of syllables. That is, the main difference between the ‘y’ in ‘yak' and the 'i' in ‘pig, is not so much the articulation (which is much the same, though the ‘y' may well be somewhat shorter), but the function of the two sounds. In ‘pig’ the segment represented by 'i’ is the nucleus (or head) of its syllable, in 'yak’ the segment represented by ‘y' is not the nucleus (the ‘a' is), but rather the onset. So we might say for English and many other languages that a vowel is a sound produced with open approximation and which is a syllable nucleus: (his will exclude glides, which are not nuclei. and will also exclude syllabic liquids and nasals (as in the final sounds of 'throstle’ and 'mutton') since these are not produced with open approximation.
