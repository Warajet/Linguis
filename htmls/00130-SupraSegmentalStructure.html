<font size = "+5">Supra-segmental structure </font>
<p>
    Thus far, we have considered speech sounds, or segments, as individual units. When we use speech, however, we do not produce segments as individual items: rather, they are part of larger constructions. One such 'larger construction' that sounds can be combined together to form is the syllable. Coming up with a straightforward definition of the syllable is no easy task (but see Section 6.1.1 for some discussion): speakers nonetheless have an intuitive idea of what the syllable is. We can, for instance, count them, or tap in time to them, quite easily: most speakers of English would agree that the word ‘rabbit' has two syllables, that 'elephant’ has three syllables and that 'armadillo' has four. While all these syllables are different, in the sense that they are made up of different segments. they nonetheless share certain structural properties: they all have a vowel. and this vowel may be preceded and/or followed by one or more consonants: the first syllable of ‘elephant' is just the vowel represented orthographically as the second is a vowel preceded by a consonant ‘le’, and the third is a vowel preceded by one consonantal sound (orthographically ‘ph') and followed by two consonant segments, so, while consonants appear to be optional in syllable structure, vowels seem to be obligatory. The facts are actually more complex than this. since many languages, including English, allow nasals and liquids to form a syllable without a vowel, e.g. ‘bottle'. These liquids and nasals are known as syllabic. The vowel is said to be the peak or nucleus of the syllable, with any consonants preceding the nucleus said to be in the syllable onset, and any following the nucleus said to be in the syllable coda, so the first syllable in ‘rabbit’ has an ‘r’ sound in the onset, the vowel represented by ‘a' in the nucleus. and no coda: (the second syllable has a single consonant in the onset (even though the orthography has two symbols, 'bb'), the vowel represented by ‘i’ as the nucleus. and a single coda consonant ‘t’. As well as being aware of how many syllables there are, speakers can usually also recognise that when we have a sequence of syllables, making up a word or a sentence, some syllables are ‘stronger' or ‘more noticeable' than others. Thus, in ‘rabbit’ and 'elephant’ the first syllable is more noticeable than the others, whereas in ‘armadillo' it's the third syllable that is most noticeable: in a sentence like ‘Albert went to the zoo’ we can usually agree that the final syllable (‘zoo') is more prominent than any of the others. That is, we can recognise that some syllables carry more stress than others. Stressed syllables produced with more muscular effort, and are louder and longer than unstressed syllables. We shall have more to say about syllables and stress in Chapter 6.
